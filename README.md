fallout-hacking-minigame
========================

A recreation of the hacking mini-game from Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in C++

Compile with your favourite C++ compiler.

You will be prompted for a difficulty level between 1-5 when you start up. 5 is pretty damn impossible and 1 is really easy, I would suggest sticking between 3-4 if you want a challenge.

Words are randomly selected from words.txt. The correct word is not displayed if you lose!

Have fun.
